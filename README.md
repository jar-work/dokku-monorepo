## Install

```
dokku plugin:install https://gitlab.com/notpushkin/dokku-monorepo
```

## Usage

```
$ ls
.dokku-monorepo
myapp1
myapp2
```

The file .dokku-monorepo contains paths for applications to be deployed:
```
first=myapp1
second=myapp2/backend
```

The part before `=` is used to identify the dokku application. For example, here:
```
$ git remote -v
first             dokku@dokku.me:example-first
first-staging     dokku@dokku.me:example-first-staging
second            dokku@dokku.me:example-second
```

the `example-first` and `example-staging-first` applications would be deployed from the `myapp1` folder.

When you push the code to an application's remote, the folder gets detected for you:
```
$ git push first

It's that easy!
